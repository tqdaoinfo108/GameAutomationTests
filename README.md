This is an example repository for running tests using `AltTester Unity SDK 2.0.1` and BrowserStack App Automate. 

## Executing tests using `AltTester Unity SDK 2.0.1` (without BrowserStack).
### Prerequisite

1. Download and install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
2. Have a build [instrumented with AltTester SDK 2.0.1](https://alttester.com/app/uploads/AltTester/TrashCat/TrashCatStandalone2.0.1.zip).
3. Have [AltTester Desktop app, 2.0.1](https://alttester.com/alttester/#pricing) installed (to be able to inspect game).
- For SDK v2.0.1 => need to use AltTester Desktop 2.0.1
4. Add AltTester package:
```
dotnet add package AltTester-Driver --version 2.0.1
```

#### Specific for running on Android from Windows
5. Download and install [ADB for Windows](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)
6. Enable Developers Options on mobile device [more instructions here](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/)

# Setup for running on mobile device
For Android, here is a [build instrumented with AltTester SDK 2.0.1](https://alttester.com/app/uploads/AltTester/TrashCat/TrashCatAndroid2.0.1.zip).

1. Make sure mobile device is connected via USB, execute:

```
adb devices
```

2. On mobile device: allow USB Debugging access (RSA key fingerprint from computer)

3. Uninstall the app from the device

```
adb uninstall com.Altom.TrashCat
```

4. Install the app on the device

```
adb install TrashCat.apk
```

# Run tests manually (with [dotnet CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test))
! **When running v2.0.0 make sure to have the AltTester Desktop App running**

1. [Optional to do manually] Setup ADB reverse port forwarding (this can also be done in code in Setup and Teardown)

```
adb reverse remove tcp:13000
```

```
	
```

2. Launch game

```
adb shell am start -n com.Altom.TrashCat/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity
```

3. Execute all tests:

```
dotnet test
```

4. Kill app
```
adb shell am force-stop com.Altom.TrashCat
```


### Run all tests from a specific class / file

```
dotnet test --filter <test_class_name>
```

### Run only one test from a class

```
dotnet test --filter <test_class_name>.<test_name>
```
